**RozsLib is a minecraft plugin development library.**

**Features**

- BossBar management
- Yaml and Json file management
- MySQL administration
- Inventory and event management
- Colorization management
- Some custom events

**So, are we free to use it?**

Of course we are. You just need to get a maven connection. You can use it in your own plugin. But to open your plugin, the people using the plugin have to install the Library on their own servers!


#### Maven

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.weesli</groupId>
  <artifactId>weesli-rozslib</artifactId>
  <version>{VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```


**Can we customize it?**

If you want to add your own features to the library, please share it with us so that more people can get support :)
